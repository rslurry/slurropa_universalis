# **Slurropa Universalis**

This is the Slurropa Universalis mod, where slurry (that's me, I'm slurry) rebalances/adds things in EU5. It is very much a work in progress, with more to come as I have time.

Big thank you to **Bastiram** for contributions to this mod.

---

# **Wars**
- Truce lengths have been doubled vs. base game.

---

# **Navy**
- Heavy ship construction costs have been doubled vs. base game.

---

# **HRE**
- Allowed republics to become Prince Electors.
- Allow dismantle HRE peace deal if the HRE has fewer than 400 locations (starts with 1049 locations, north and south Germany total 800 locations). This allows people to remove land from the HRE and not harm their progress toward dismantling.

---

# **Hegemons**
- Disabled hegemon diplomatic actions because they are incredibly toxic and dumb for MP since you cannot refuse them. This will be removed once Paradox pushes an update to allow targets to refuse the hegemon's diplo action.

---

# **Great Power Score**
- Reduced the influence of population to 50% of the base game's value. Population influences income, which is also a GP score factor, and this double dipping leads to dumb results (like a country in eastern China having more GP score from population than any other GP has in total score, despite that they would get whooped by half of those other GPs).
- Reduced country rank's influence by 50% (e.g., empire changed from 200 to 100).
- Reduced HRE Emperorship's influence from 250 to 150.

# **Cabinet Actions**

### **Expel people:** now more limited
The province must have:
- the country's capital, **or**
- at least 50 control in all locations, **or**
- at least 25 control in all locations **and** some amount of Centralization.

---

# **Covert Actions**

### **Infiltrate Administration:** nerfed this OP covert action
- Increased spy network cost from 50 to 75.
- Duration is 1 year, with a cooldown of 3 years, meaning you cannot use this on multiple countries at the same time.
- Moved to 3rd age, locked behind printing press.
- Note: due to Paradox’s infinite wisdom, the vanilla Infiltrate Administration covert action is impossible to remove from the UI because it is hardcoded, so you will see **two** Infiltrate Administrations — the vanilla one (999 cost, unusable) and the modded one (75 cost, age 3 requirement).

# **Situations**

### **Treaty of Tordesillas**
- Disabled this very poorly implemented situation until Paradox fixes it into something usable.

---

# **Climate**

The philosophy of this mod is that a location’s climate should reflect where humans actually live, not the average climate across the entire location. This better reflects reality for tags like the Inca, who historically had extensive agriculture, but whose EU5 arctic designation makes them grow almost no food.  Changes are based on the Köppen–Geiger climate classifications and translating them into EU5’s climate system.  Changes:
- Adjusted climates in western South America to better reflect where humans actually live and to make the region playable. See pic #2 for details.
- Adjusted climates in southeast/east Iberia, Mallorca, Canaries, Azores, and slightly in eastern Italy to better reflect reality. See pic #3 for details.
- Adjusted climates in Scandinavia to better reflect where humans actually live (e.g., Trondheim area of Norway) and reality (e.g., southern Finland). See pic #4 for details.

# **Borders**

### **Qusqu**
Qusqu, the tag that historically wins out in western South America, is unplayable at present. The devs intend for you to ally Ayarmaca, but they failed to account for the fact that Ayarmaca will probably rival you and definitely attack you 100% of the time before you can ally them. Qusqu simply does not have enough pops/levies to survive any opening war unless you get very lucky.  Changes:
- Pisaq transferred from Ayarmaca to Qusqu. Ayarmaca’s capital moved to Urupampa.
- Pikillaqta (only location of Pinaguq tag) absorbed into Qusqu.

---

# **Historicalness**

### **Yemen**
Yemen was historically the Arabian peninsula’s breadbasket, yet Paradox treats it as a backwater. We fixed that (more changes TBD to fix pop capacity issues).

- Boosted development of the region and added terraces to locations that historically had terracing or terrace-like agriculture methods. *(Contributed by Bastiram)*
- Turned Sana’a into the city it was at that time; turned Zabid, Sa’da, and Say’un into towns for historical reasons. *(Contributed by Bastiram)*

# **Want to contribute to the mod?**
I'd love to have more help with this mod, as there are a lot of things that can be improved in EU5 that I won't have time to do until much later on. If you're interested in contributing, familiarize with the code structure, and open an issue to discuss the changes you want to contribute.  Once we have a plan in place, then you can submit a pull request with those changes.  Ambitious people may go ahead and submit a pull request without first discussing it, but there is no guarantee it will be accepted without further changes.  Thanks!
